# Privacy Policy for Zeanso

**Last updated: February 10, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.

## 1. Introduction

"Zeanso" ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application (the "App") collects, uses, and shares information about you.

By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Bluetooth Data
Our App connects to external prosthetic devices via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). To facilitate this connection, the App may scan for nearby BLE devices.
- **Purpose**: To discover, connect to, and communicate with your prosthetic device for parameter adjustment and data monitoring (e.g., step count, battery level).
- **Data**: We process real-time data from the device, such as sensor readings and device status. This data is processed locally on your device.

### 2.2 Location Information
- **Purpose**: 
    - **Android**: To scan for Bluetooth devices (system requirement).
    - **iOS & Android**: To verify the authorized region of use for institutional users.
- **Usage**: 
    - We use location services to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices.
    - For **Institutional Users (Org Version)**: We access your approximate location during the device activation or authorization process to verify that the device is being used within its designated region. If the location does not match the authorized region, the device may be locked.
- **Data Retention**: We do not track or store your continuous GPS location history. Location data is processed instantly for verification purposes.

### 2.3 User Input
We may collect information you provide directly, such as:
- Device authorization codes (for institutional users).
- App settings and preferences.

## 3. How We Use Information

We use the information we collect to:
- enable Bluetooth connectivity with your prosthetic device.
- provide key features such as gait parameter adjustment, mode switching, and firmware updates.
- ensure the security and authorized use of the device (through region locking mechanisms).
- improve the App's performance and fix bugs.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

**We do not sell your personal data.** We may share information only in the following circumstances:
- **With Your Consent**: We may share information when you direct us to do so.
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

## 5. Security

We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. The communication between the App and the prosthetic device uses standard Bluetooth protocols.

## 6. Accessing and Updating Your Information

You can access and update your preferences within the App's settings page. You may also stop the collection of location information by disabling location services in your device settings, though this will prevent the Bluetooth scanning feature from working on Android devices.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
